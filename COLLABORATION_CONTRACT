1. ARTIFACT CONTRIBUTION

Problem: Understanding the functional increments in adjusting products from the last SPL release (i.e., Customization Analysis).

Context
  Domain: Software Product Lines
  Stakeholder: Change control boards, SPL Developers
  Time: Interim between SPL releases.
  Space: SPL Organizations.

Solution:

  DP Flow-ness: 
    To allow track customization efforts as flows that irrigate distinct SPL orchards for use by SPL managers in the interim between SPL releases employ alluvial diagrams involving SPL managers because of [-].

  DP Highlighting: 
    To prevent not feeling lost in the tangle of flow branches for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ tracement of flows through the alluvial diagram graph involving [-] because of [-].

  DP Zoom-ness: 
    For SPL manager to allow account for different needs for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ expansion/contraction of alluvial diagram flow involving [-] because of [-]

  DP Grouping: 
    For SPL manager to allow for displaying the dispersion of the customization effort for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ grouping of user-specific concerns (e.g., product units, parent features, product configurations) involving [-] because of [-].

  DP Scattering:
    For SPL manager to allow for displaying how features are spread along distinct features for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ feature scattering view involving [-] because of [-].

  DP Tangling:
    For SPL manager to allow for displaying the interaction with other features for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ feature tangling view involving [-] because of [-].

  DP DiffView:
    For SPL manager to allow for calibrating the consolidation effort for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ a Diff view through hiper-links that shows the code behind the code churn involving [-] because of [-].

  DP Feature filtering: 
    For SPL managers to allow for focusing the analysis on specific products or features and to keep the number of nodes at bay for use by SPL developers in the interim between SPL releases employ filtering mechanisms in feature-centric perspective involving [-] because of [-].
